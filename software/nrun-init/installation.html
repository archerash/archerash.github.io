      <h1>Installation Guide</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to nrun-init installation guide! A simple init system designed for Unix/Linux systems. Before we continue keep in mind that changing init system on your OS can be risky and might break a lot of software. It is not recommended to do that on distros that only support systemd. This installation guide assumes you know how init systems, bootloader etc. work and you are using GRUB as a bootloader. I am not responsible for any damages that nrun-init has done to your OS, data, hardware etc. Download it on your computer at your own risk (recommended to install inside a VM first).
      </p>
      
      <p>First, lets clone nrun-init repo and cd into it</p>
      <code>git clone https://github.com/archerash/nrun-init<br>
      cd nrun-init</code>
      <p>Then, we can compile it into ELF binary using gcc</p>
      <code>gcc nrun/src/* -o ./nrun-bin</code>

      <p>When it finishes compiling, lets move our nrun-bin to /usr/bin</p>
      <code>sudo mv ./nrun-bin /usr/bin</code>

      <p>Then you have to create /var/on which is a place for services that will be ran by nrun-bin at boot</p>
      <code>sudo mkdir /var/on</code>
      
      <p>Lets now write an simple service (shell script) that will run tty everytime we boot</p>
      <code>touch tty && chmod +x tty<br>
        ./tty file content:
        #!/bin/sh
        exec agetty --noclear 38400 tty1 linux
      </code>

      <p>Lets move our file to /var/on</p>
      <code>sudo mv ./tty /var/on</code>

      <p>After it, you can reboot your OS and in GRUB press 'e' when targetting your boot option and look for init= flag, if you can find it go to the line beginning with linux and add init=/usr/bin/nrun-bin at the end of it. Press CTRL-X and it will boot your OS with nrun-bin as init system</p>

      <p>If system will boot properly and give you tty login window try to login and execute command <code>ps aux | grep 1</code>, if PID 1 process is something like nrun-init or nrun-bin it means you are using nrun. Now you can write more services e.g to run NetworkManager or your login manager and add these to /var/on</p>

      <p>Currently there is no way to start a service without restarting OS and running it manually as a command, however I am working on tools that can be used to manage &amp; monitor services.</p>
